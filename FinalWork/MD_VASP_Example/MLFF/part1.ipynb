    "*Compute the training-set and test-set errors of an MLFF model for given reference data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Error estimation of an MLFF model gives insights into the accuracy of the trained model and how the model generalizes to out-of-training-set structures. In machine-learning approaches, one generally differentiates between two types of errors: The training-set error and the test-set error. The training-set error is evaluated on the training set. It is computed as the error between the values of the density-functional-theory (DFT) calculation used for fitting and the MLFF prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test-set error is evaluated using an external test set that was not utilized during the training process. It is considered good practice to sample the configurations in the test set under the same conditions as those employed in the MLFF production runs. For example, the structures in the test set should possess the same number of atoms as the production run, even if the initial training was conducted on structures with fewer atoms. Furthermore, the test set must be collected in the same thermodynamic phase as the one in which the production run will take place. When test-set error analysis is conducted in this manner, it provides insights into how well the MLFF model generalizes from the training set to the production conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are three cases which can be distinguished for the comparison of training-set and test-set errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A low training-set error and a high test-set error indicate overfitting. This scenario means that your force field is bad at extrapolating to structures outside of the training set. Improving this force field is necessary, either by including more training structures or by tuning hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A training-set error and a test-set error that are roughly of the same size indicate that your force field will work as long as both errors are low enough for the desired application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A high training-set error and a low test-set error indicate that your test set is biased, i.e., not general enough.\n",
    "\n",

    "To do a refitting, the [INCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/INCAR) file only contains two tags: [ML_LMLFF](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_LMLFF) to switch on the machine-learning mode and [ML_MODE](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_MODE) to select the refitting mode. In general, refitting should always be done after a [ML_AB](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_AB) file was obtained during on-the-fly training. This will generally result in a more accurate MLFF because the model weights are determined via [linear regression](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Machine_learning_force_field:_Theory#Bayesian_linear_regression) using [singular-value decomposition](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Machine_learning_force_field:_Theory#Solution_via_regularized_SVD) instead of [evidence approximation](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Machine_learning_force_field:_Theory#Evidence_approximation).

    "The plot contains three different errors. The energy error, the force error and the error of the stress tensor. The red part of the plot shows the data points computed during this tutorial. In principle, it is always good to have all three errors as small as possible. But there might also be cases where the user has to pay special attention to one of them. For example, for the computation of defect-formation energies, the MLFF model should be optimized to minimize the energy error. In contrast, phonon frequencies require a MLFF model with minimal errors of the forces. To pay special attention to one of the errors, weights for the quantity of interest can be set during fitting. To increase the importance of the total energy during fitting, adjust the value of [ML_WTOTEN](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_WTOTEN). Similarly, the importance of the forces is set by [ML_WTIFOR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_WTIFOR) and the weight factor for the stress tensor by [ML_WTSIF](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ML_WTSIF).
